# exosyspop

This package generates Monte Carlo simulations of transiting planet and eclipsing binary star populations, given population parameters.

It uses (& requires) `isochrones <github.com/timothydmorton/isochrones>`_ `vespa <github.com/timothydmorton/vespa>`_.  


Install by cloning the repository and installing::

    git clone https://github.com/timothydmorton/exosyspop
    cd exosyspop
    python setup.py install

If you don't already have `vespa` and `isochrones`, this should take care of that as well.
